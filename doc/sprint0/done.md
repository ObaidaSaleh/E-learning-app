# Definition of Done

1. Unit testing is complete (written + passed)
2. Code reviewing is complete (preferably by 1 person)
3. Acceptance criteria have been met
4. Functional tests passed
5. Non-functional requirements met
6. Code compiles with no errors or warnings
7. Product Owner accepts User Story

Notes:
- The whole team need to agree as to what "done" means before each story is broken down into tasks
- All steps must be done before the user story is marked as complete
